### Languages

Some languages that enhance somehow Python with more functional programming capabilities.

- [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/) - "A dialect of Lisp that’s embedded in Python".
- [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/) - "Simple, elegant, Pythonic functional programming".
- [Mochi](https://github.com/i2y/mochi) - "A dynamically typed programming language for functional programming and actor-style programming.".
- [Tydy](https://github.com/cyrus-/tydy) - "Tydy is a statically typed, functional-first programming language in the ML tradition. tydy is an implementation of Tydy as a Python library."
- [dg (aka dogelang)](https://pyos.github.io/dg/) - "A programming language that compiles to CPython bytecode, much like Scala compiles to JVM's. That essentially means that dg is an alternative syntax for Python 3."
- [pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie) - "A lightweight and native lisp built in RPython".
